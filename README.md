#Problem Statement

Developed a java application which has details about the inventory stock where the user can buy the items among three different categories. They are:
* Essentials
* Luxury
* Misc
Every category has a quantity cap limit on items that are purchased in single order. The items ordered should be validated whether they exceeds the existing stock count of inventory items. If the provided card details for payment doesnt exist, then the card value must be added to the database.  When the user's request satisfies all the validations, a CSV file is generated with the details of successful order's invoice.
